# EDA-project1

In this project we have followed some simple steps for each of the four plots

* First we downloaded the data set and read into R.
* Then we have subsetted the data for the  dates 2007-02-01 and 2007-02-02.
* After that we have initialized graphic device "png" so that whatever plot we will make
  wil be saved directly to the png file format.
* Then we have plotted the data as shown in figures.
